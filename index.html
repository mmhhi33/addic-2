        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch
          koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from
          the Arabic qahwah (قهوة).[10] The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally
          held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab
          lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahiya (قَهِيَ), "to lack
          hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
          suppressant. It has also been proposed that the source may be the
          Proto-Central Semitic root q-h-h meaning "dark".[11] Alternatively,
          the word Khat, a plant widely used as a stimulant in Yemen and
          Ethiopia before being supplanted by coffee has been suggested as a
          possible origin, or the Arabic word quwwah' (meaning "strength").[12]
          It may also come from the Kingdom of Kaffa in southeast Ethiopia where
          Coffea arabica grows wild, but this is considered less likely;[11] in
          the local Kaffa language, the coffee plant is instead called
          "bunno".[13]

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from
          which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially
          cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as
          'robusta') and C. arabica.[41] C. arabica, the most highly regarded
          species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the
          Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and possibly Mount Marsabit in
          northern Kenya.[42] C. canephora is native to western and central
          Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[43] Less
          popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C.
          racemosa.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          According to legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of
          Kaffa in Ethiopia were believed to have been the first to recognize
          the energizing effect of the coffee plant,[6] though no direct
          evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee first grew
          or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant,
          earlier than the 15th century.[6] The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century
          Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited
          his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not
          appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[6] Other
          accounts attribute the discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According
          to an ancient chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript),
          Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer,
          was once exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab
          (modern-day Wusab, about 90 km east of Zabid).[15] Starving, Omar
          chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but found them to be bitter. He
          tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard.
          He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a
          fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized
          and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached
          Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.[16]
